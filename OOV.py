#name: v7_*
# Code which takes uspantekan or spanish small data (100 sent) about two classes
education and dancing, runs it through a QNLP model, which is supported by a fasttext model,
and two neural network models to learn and make prediction.
#to get blow by blow details of what this code does, refer to a section named
"how this code runs" inside the project plan
https://github.com/ua-datalab/QNLP/blob/main/Project-Plan.md

4 major models used in this code. 
1. QNLP model, called model1
2. Fast text embedding model , called model 2
3. NN model that learns mapping between fast text embedding and QNLP trained model's weights
4. Prediction model - which is use dto predict on test set.
#todo, find why not just do model1.predict?

    comment@nov 6th2024. Below is the chronological log of my encounter 
    with a bug and how i fixed it. todo: move it eventually to a bug fix faq from code comment
    
    error@ oct16th 2024- 
    below code is egiving the error,  i.e when trying to evaluate on val dataset

     File "/Users/mithun/miniconda3/envs/qnlp/lib/python3.12/site-packages/lambeq/training/pytorch_model.py", line 142, in get_diagram_output
    raise KeyError(
KeyError: 'Unknown symbol: √∫nicamente_0__s

    Note this is only 
    a) after commenting the qnlp_model.weights ka problem
    inside the function generate_initial_parameterisation()
    which means, we kind of ignore/commented out that problem, 
    and here is the next one. 

    b) when we are trying to evaluate on val dataset


    What this error means is that: √∫nicamente_0__s is not found 
    to get the diagram output for. Mostlikely it is looking
    for embedding of √∫nicamente_0__s inside train_embeddings.

    "the exact line 143 can be found in this part of the LAMBEQ code:https://github.com/CQCL/lambeq/blob/8109d952d707880b8588e0d04f24f0b5a94c3d59/lambeq/training/pytorch_model.py#L140

    what that line is doing is that, it is going through circuits of val data,
    extracting each of the root word from it, and 
    asking for the weights of that word from a dictionary called
      parameters = {k: v for k, v in zip(self.symbols, self.weights)}
      which has all symbols as keys and its weights as values
      i.e self.symbols and self.weights are zipped, and combined as a dictionary
      
      todo: 
      1. find if our self.symbols and self.weights have same size.
      update; answer =
      len(qnlp_model.symbols)
463
len(qnlp_model.weights)
463
(qnlp_model.symbols[0])
(aldea_0__s
qnlp_model.weights[0]
Parameter containing:
tensor([-0.0098,  0.7008], requires_grad=True)

      2. it is asking for √∫nicamente_0__s- which shouldnt happen because 
      our dictionaries are all stored as {plain text name: embedding} i.e
       just "√∫nicamente".
       3. unicamente is from val data, why are we comparing/asking for its embedding from 
       model.symbols- which has only training data?

       update: finally figured out what is going on:
       WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE THE BASIC QNLP MODEL ON VAL dataset
       because
        a) qnlp_model is by definition handicapped. i.e it doesn't know
         what to do with OOV words. I was using it for prediction 
         on val dataset itself in the below code i.e val_preds
         instead of train_preds
         is wrong methodology because Qnlp_model doesn't know how to handle OOV
          b)  the whole purpose of creating all the models 2, 3,4 and then 
       the OOV_prediction model is those 4 models below, which KNOW HOW TO 
       HANDLE OOV
       I.E the final accuracy calculation on val/dev SHOULD ONLY BE DONE
       USING THESE 4 models and NEVER using the base qnlp_model.- unless oov count ==0

    data. This is the OOV problem. remember, Model 1 the way it predicts is
    if you give the circuits, it will multiply by its weights and tell you
    the exact class the circuit belongs to. however, remember, it has no idea how 
    to convert an OOV word to circuit. Which is why we went back to fasttext
    embeddings. But then we realized, just having fast text embeddings of thew new
    dev/val data is not alone enough, but we want to instead get the corresponding
    weights of it from model 1. That is why we trained another NN model called
    model3 (aka NN_model) which gives you the corresponding weights of the new sentences.
    Now coming back to your question of why not use model 1. as of now model 1 has learned
    weights for only KNOWN words,. If you give the weights of UNKNOWN words , like those
    found in dev, it is WRONG. So the best way is, create a new QNLP model (exactly like
    model 1) called model4, assign its weights to be what model 3 (the OOV_NN) model predicted
    and now give the corresponding circuits of dev data (just like model 1 would have done
    if it could) and ask it to multiply circuitsx weights and give a class prediction.
