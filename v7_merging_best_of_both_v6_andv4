# Code which takes uspantekan or spanish small data (100 sent) about two classes
education and dancing, runs it through a QNLP model, which is supported by a fasttext model,
and two neural network models to learn and make prediction.
#to get blow by blow details of what this code does, refer to a section named
"how this code runs" inside the project plan
https://github.com/ua-datalab/QNLP/blob/main/Project-Plan.md

4 major models used in this code. 
1. QNLP model, called model1
2. Fast text embedding model , called model 2
3. NN model that learns mapping between fast text embedding and QNLP trained model's weights
4. Prediction model - which is use dto predict on test set.
#todo, find why not just do model1.predict?

    and here is the next one. 

    b) when we are trying to evaluate on val dataset


    What this error means is that: únicamente_0__s is not found 
    to get the diagram output for. Mostlikely it is looking
    for embedding of únicamente_0__s inside train_embeddings.

    "the exact line 143 can be found in this part of the LAMBEQ code:https://github.com/CQCL/lambeq/blob/8109d952d707880b8588e0d04f24f0b5a94c3d59/lambeq/training/pytorch_model.py#L140

    what that line is doing is that, it is going through circuits of val data,
    extracting each of the root word from it, and 
    asking for the weights of that word from a dictionary called
      parameters = {k: v for k, v in zip(self.symbols, self.weights)}
      which has all symbols as keys and its weights as values
      i.e self.symbols and self.weights are zipped, and combined as a dictionary
      
      todo: 
      1. find if our self.symbols and self.weights have same size.
      update; answer =
      len(qnlp_model.symbols)

len(qnlp_model.weights)

(qnlp_model.symbols[0])
(aldea_0__s
qnlp_model.weights[0]
Parameter containing:
tensor([-0.0098,  0.7008], requires_grad=True)

      2. it is asking for únicamente_0__s- which shouldnt happen because 
      our dictionaries are all stored as {plain text name: embedding} i.e
       just "únicamente".
       3. unicamente is from val data, why are we comparing/asking for its embedding from 
       model.symbols- which has only training data?

       update: finally figured out what is going on:
       WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE THE BASIC QNLP MODEL ON VAL dataset
       because
        a) qnlp_model is by definition handicapped. i.e it doesn't know
         what to do with OOV words.SO using it for prediction on val dataset itself
         is wrong methodology because Qnlp_model doesn't know how to handle OOV
          b)  the whole purpose of creating all the models 2, 3,4 and then 
       the OOV_prediction model is those 4 models below, which KNOW HOW TO 
       HANDLE OOV
       I.E the final accuracy calculation on val/dev SHOULD ONLY BE DONE
       USING THESE 4 models and NEVER using the base qnlp_model.
